# Loading dataset
To find the total number of participants, we took all submissions and then removed those from people who were outside the country (see question 1) and those from people who had not completed the first ten questions (i.e. those people who did not complete the first page of the survey).

# Section 1. Social demographic
In this section, we determine some information about the demographics of the respondents: country of work, qualification, gender, age, ethnic origin, salary, and disabilities.

## Country of work
The data was cleaned to remove all participants that were not working in South Africa.
### In which country do you work?

## Qualifications
The highest proportion of RSEs hold a *doctorate* (68%) as their highest qualification but only by a margin when compared to *master degree* (23%).

Most RSEs derive from a background in *Physics and Astronomy* (55%). None of the other field contain more than 1 participant (except the possibility *Other*).

### What is the highest qualification you have obtained?
### In which subject is your highest academic qualification?

## Gender
Only one participants answered *Female* to the question of gender while 92% of the participant (n=12) reported to be *Male*. 9 (over 22) participants did not answer that question.

### Please select your gender

## Age
The age of the participants are concentrated in the two lowest age ranges, the *25 to 34 years* (38%, n=5) and the *35 to 44 years* (38%, N=5).

### Please select your age

## Ethnic origin
The participants are predominantly white (92%, n=12), only one participant reported being black.


### How would you describe your ethnic origin? This refers to people who share the same cultural background and identity, not country of birth or nationality.

## Salary
Almost half of the RSE in South Africa earn *Between R 708 311 and R 1 500 000* (46%, n=6), while the second highest range of salary is *Between R 296 541 and R 410 460* (23%, n=3).

### Please select the range of your annual salary

## Disability
No participant reported any form of disability.

### Do you have a condition that is defined as a disability by the White Paper on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2015)

## Professional qualifications
### Do you hold any other professional degrees/qualifications? (Please enter each of them separated by a semicolon)


# Section 2: Questions about coding
In this section we investigate the relationship between RSEs and the code they develop.

As expected, the vast majority of RSEs (86%, n=19) write code. 15% (n=3) of the participants write code for themselves while the vast majority write code for other people (85%, n=17).

However, despite the majority of them writing code, only 23% (n=5) consider themselves as *professional software developer*. This is a low number when we consider the average time of developing software (14 years) and that they are mainly developing software for others.

Surprisingly, the participants do not spend much of their time coding, but doing research. Software development come only second in the most time consuming task. The second type of question asked if the participants wanted to spend more time than what they do. Here again, the participants seems to want to spend more time doing research. Again, software development comes second. They are mainly coming from the North-West University and the University of Pretoria (40%, n=4 and 20%, n=2) but 12 participants did not answer to that question.


### Do you write code as part of your job?
### Who uses the code that you write?
### Do you consider yourself a professional software developer?
### How many years of Software development experience do you have?
### In an average month, how much time do you spend on software development (Please rate your answer between 1 to 10. 1 Being none at all and 10 being All your time.); In an average month, how much time do you spend on Research; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Management; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Teaching; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Other activities

### In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on programming? (Please rate your answer between 1 to 10. 1 Being none at all and 10 being All your time.); In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Research; In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Management; In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Teaching


# Section 3: Questions about employment

The participants work principally for an university (45%, n=10) and for research organisation (32%, n=7).
They work in more different field than they come from. The majority still works in Physics and Astronomy (29%, n=12) but several of them are working in Computer Science (12%, n=5), Mathematics (10%, n=4) and Education (7%, n=3).

### What type of organisation do you work for?
### Which University? Please please provide the full official name of the university or organisation e.g. University of Cape Town if your organisation is not listed
### Which organisation do you work for?
### What is your official job title?
### Are you known by a different job title? If so, please enter the job title you use
### In which disciplines do you work (select as many as apply)


# Section 4: Questions about the type of contract

Almost all the participants are employed under full time contract (82%, n=18) and they are mainly Permanent (either funded by University core funding, or as long as funding is available. But this apparent stability in contract has to be tempered with the average length of the contract (5 years). On the origin of their funding (which 72%, n=13 of the participants know the origin), it seems that the type of funding is not applicable for them (40%, n=4) or that it comes from Grants (30%, n=3).  This is the method of Grants that is also privilegied as funding process for their current larger project (50%, n=5) and for their previous largest project too (50%, n=5).


### Do you work full time or part time
### What type of contract are you employed on?
### What is the total duration of your current employment (in years)?
### Do you know the source of the funding used to support you and your current, largest project?
### Which of the following sources are used to pay for your effort as an RSE/equivalent?
### Which of the following sources are used to fund your current, largest project?
### Which of the following sources were used to fund your current, largest project three years ago?


# Section 5: Questions about previous employment
Several questions were about the participants previous job. The idea is to collect insight of their career and understand what are their motivation to be an RSE.

More than a half of the participants worked in a university prior to their current position (59%, n=13), added to this majority, 9%, n=2 come from Research organisation.
At least 14%, n=3 shift career and moved from the private sector to academy and for 18%, n=4 it is their first job.

We asked the participants to rank the reasons why they chose their actual position among 8 different ones:
* Desire to work in a research environment
* Freedom to choose own working practices
* Desire to advance research
* I want to learn new skills
* Opportunity to develop software
* Flexible working hours
* Ability to work across disciplines
* Opportunity for career advancement
* The salary

It appears that the Desire to advance research, and the Ability to work across disciplines are the biggest reasons why the RSE chose their current position.
On the contrary, the salary and the Opportunity to develop software are the least common reasons for choosing a position as RSE. The lack of interest in developing software was also visible when we asked them in which activity they would spend more of their time.

### Where was your previous job based?
### Rank the following factors dependent on how strongly they influenced your decision to accept your current position


# Section 6: Collaboration and training
RSEs do not work for themselves, their role involves writing code that is used by others (as seen in section 2), but the collaboration can take other forms. This is why we asked with whom the participants work with. Usually, they seems to be embedded in a stable group, 58% (n=11) of them report to work with the same researchers, while a minority has a more flexible collaboration (42%, n=8).
On the side of collaboration, we wanted to know if they were working within a stable group of researcher software. It appears they are not embedded in any research group for the majority of them (79%, n=15). However, they are working in team were other fellow developers are involved. In average they have 2 other fellow developers in their team, often coming from the same institution (42%, n=8).
Working for researchers or working within a research software group is different than working on the same project with other developers. On average they work on 3 different projects at the same time.

RSEs have programming skills that is not necessarily shared within their field. Therefore, they can train other researchers to develop some best practices or learn how to program more efficiently. Half of the participants provide such training (50%, n=9). They are not teaching directly to students but transferring skills is an important aspect of their job. In average, they do training twice a year. These trainings are more often done under the form of workshop or the software carpentry program than traditional teaching. A type of training probably more adapted to teach computing skills.

# Section 7: Publications

RSEs is an hybrid role between a researcher and a software developer. We investigated both of these aspects concerning publication and dissemination of their work, one on the traditional aspect of it (publications and conference) and on the more software aspect (open source and DOI).
One essential aspect of career in academia is the publications and the conferences to gain recognition. However, the role of RSE being less about writing articles than creating the infrastructure and the software for the article to exist, there is some fear that they will fail to have recognition through the papers and conferences.
Our results support this idea, while for 74% (n=14) of the participants, their software is used in published researches they are only 42% (n=8) (among them) who are acknowledged in the publication.

Among these participants that are acknowledged in the paper, only 38% (n=3) are generally named as main author for the paper. Among the 62% of those who are not main author, % are at least mentioned as co-authors. And among these last 22% of RSEs that are not mentioned as co-author or main author, 69% are at least generally acknowledged in the main text of the paper.
On conference, the number of RSEs that present their work in conference is rather small, only 56%, when compared to the paper publications.

Software also requires specific citations, and even if the way to do it properly is not standardise yet, it is another way for RSEs to be recognised in their role, but also giving recognition to others that develop software. In that perspective, we asked them *how do they reference software directly or the papers describing the software?*. Among the propositions they could choose, citing the specific version of the software is the most common way to cite it (43%), followed by paper about software or the software itself (32%) or software itself (25%). It is important to note that this question did not have a "No" as an option, therefore these numbers need to be put in perspective of the high number of none answer. Less than 20 % of people chose one of the options. RSEs do not seem to often cite the software they use.

The other development practice is how the code is distributed and if the RSEs are releasing their work under open licence.
We asked the participants if they have ever released their work under open source licence and 62% of them replied by the affirmative. However, as it could be considered as a small number, among these 62%, it is seems that the vast majority of them doing it all the time (42%). Therefore, as soon as the step to open source is done, it seems that RSEs seems a constant interest in it. However, they rarely use a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to help to identify their software. only 18% of them are doing it. And the frequency of use of the DOI among them is much more variable than for the open licence.

A last element about publications is the use of [ORCID](https://orcid.org/). It is an online service that allows to connect different publications and work with one identifier per researcher. Half of them are using the service.
