Learned maths and science from school and my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. Learned good software engineering from having to work with terribly engineered academic code. Learned most other things by putting myself in situations in which I would have to learn to survive, and which gave me the space to learn by trial and error. Asked people I respected how they did what they do, and listened to their feedback when both positive and negative. Always embraced new opportunities and viewed them as an opportunity to learn new skills. Spent a lot of time introspecting and reflecting on how I approached problems, and from this worked out what skills I needed to acquire and then pursued those skills via online courses, self-guided websites or University-provided training workshops (e.g. in communication, presentation with confidence and flair, grant and paper writing etc.)",1389.2,89.41,138.81,133.7,275.1,134.45,85.94,531.79,,,No,Continuous integration (travis),,,,,
