SL		surveyls_title		Study about people writing scientic software for The Netherlands		en																																																																																																																																			
SL		surveyls_welcometext		"<h1>NL-RSE Survey</h1>
<p><strong>The purpose of this survey is to collect information about people who develop software that is used in research. We call these people <em><a href=""https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers"" target=""_blank"">Research Software 
Engineers</a></em>
<a href=""https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers"" target=""_blank"">(RSEs)</a>, but they use many different job titles (including postdoctoral researcher and research 
assistant).</strong></p>
<h2>Why did I receive this invitation?</h2>
<p>You have received this link because you are working at an organisation in the Netherlands that may employ people who could identify as Research Software Engineer.
There is currently very little reliable information about the RSE community in the Netherlands,
so we have been asked to collect this information to help funders and other research organisations develop policies that will support RSEs.
This questionnaire gives you the opportunity to express your views about your current job and give us information about your career path.</p>
<p>Please note that this research is not compulsory and even if you decide to participate you can withdraw at any moment.</p>
<h2>How long will it take?</h2>
<p>There is a maximum of 64 questions in this survey. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.</p>
<h2>Who is responsible for this survey?</h2>
<p>This study is conducted by the University of Southampton on behalf of the <a href=""http://software.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Software Sustainability Institute</a> and complies with University of Southampton ethics guidelines (reference no.: ERGO/FPSE/25269).
The investigators are <a href=""mailto:s.hettrick@software.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">Simon Hettrick</a> and <a href=""mailto:olivier.philippe@soton.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">Olivier Philippe</a>.
The survey is hosted on Limesurvey servers in Germany and respects the provisions of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act"" target=""_blank"">Data Protection Act</a>. 
These records are anonymised and access is strictly protected and granted to the main researchers only. The results of the survey will be released publicly but only after they have been processed to ensure that individual respondents can not be identified.
