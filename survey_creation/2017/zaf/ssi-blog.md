South African RSE Survey 2017: Invitation to participate

We need your help with the SSI and zaf-RSE survey on research software and the people writing scientific software for South Africa. If you are coding in and for academia in South Africa then complete the survey and spread the word please: {{ADD LINK}}.

As of now there is not much knowledge about the community of those in research and science who develop software. This survey aims to gain valuable insights into this community in order to support research funders and other institutions to develop strategies and funding programs as well as policies.

Last and this years’ UK surveys [1, 2] allowed to gain valuable insights. To continue our success with this campaign, we need to track how the community evolves at other places.  Simultaneously, similar surveys will be conducted in Canada, Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, the USA and South Africa. For reasons of comparability, this survey was closely coordinated with the others.

This survey gives South African researchers and scientist the opportunity to make their point of view and experiences be heard, and thus be part of the development of this community. It would be also very helpful if you could spread the word to others who develop software in the South African research landscape, or anyone who employs software experts in German academia.

There are ca. {{ADD NUMBER OF QUESTIONS}} questions in this survey. It takes about 20 minutes to complete. Please note that this research is not compulsory and even if you decide to participate you can withdraw at any moment.

The study is conducted by the University of Southampton on behalf of the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) and complies with University of Southampton ethics guidelines (reference no.: ERGO/FPSE/30440). The investigators are Simon Hettrick and Olivier Philippe. The survey is hosted on Limesurvey servers in Germany and respects the provisions of the Data Protection Act. These records are anonymised and access is strictly protected and granted to the main researchers only. The results of the survey will be released publicly but only after they have been processed to ensure that individual respondents can not be identified.

The survey results will be published under a CC BY-NC license, and will be announced via this blog and the African Carpentries Google Group [3].

We look forward to your participation in the survey!
